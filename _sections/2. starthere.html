<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>This is a (nearly) comprehensive guide to surviving and succeeding in medical school. I'll introduce and thoroughly explain how to use various resources medical students use to pass their exams, prepare for the USMLE Step 1 and Step 2, and ready themselves for a career as a physician. Use the links on the navigation bar </p>
<h4>Who are you?</h4>
<p>I'm a 1st year medical student at a U.S. allopathic medical school. I won't say much beyond that as I'd like to remain anonymous, but I welcome and encourage any questions or concerns. Use the following link or the link in the navigation bar to contact me:

<h4>Why should I listen to you?</h4>
<p>Hmm... I haven't figured that one out yet. In all seriousness though, that's a great question. This is all just one person's opinion. I will present as much evidence as I can to explain why I do things the way I do, but it is up to you to try different methods before picking something that works best for you.</p>
<p>The advice given here comes from my personal experience as well as some extensive googling. I do not endorse blindly following everthing written here (or anywhere else on the internet). Try out some of the things I write about, talk to your fellow classmates and upperclassmen about what they recommend, and find something that works for you.</p>
